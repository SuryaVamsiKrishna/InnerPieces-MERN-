According to a survey conducted in 2018, Suicide is considered to one of the main reasons of deaths in India. It even surpasses the count of deaths by accidents by a huge difference.

A recent survey conducted by Cigna TTK Health Insurance found that about 89% of the people in India admitted to have been suffering from stress and the global average is 86%. These results are truly disheartening.
